!! IMPORTANT:
- Requires Spring 2022 Update (beta), see note below

Incentivizes building optimal infrastructure by increasing maintenance and build costs of various pieces of infrastructure, such as tracks, stations, depots, etc.
Costs change dynamically and non-linearly as you progress through the years. So at 1850 you will mostly see the default low costs but they will gradually increase.
Maintenance costs will keep increasing even for previously constructed pieces of infrastructure, so make sure to get rid of unused stuff to prevent extra costs piling up!

See tooltips for every slider for additional information.


>> Compatibility with new Advanced Settings (Spring 2022 Update):

- Infrastructure Build Costs should work as you expect and act as additional multiplier on top of Cost setting. But it's recommended to set it to 100% to simplify the math.
- Infrastructure Maintenance Costs MUST be set at 100% in Advanced Settings, otherwise calculations for extra maintenance costs will be slightly off the expected value.


>> Known issues/limitations:

- Build costs of tracks and roads will not be affected by inflation, due to modding API limitations. But maintenance costs will!
- Red floating numbers will keep showing the original unmodified maintenance costs. Rest assured, additional fees will be deducted from your account behind the scenes. You can monitor this in Finances window.
- Refund amounts for individual station modules will still be based on original (lower) module price, so you might get much less money back than you expect. This is also modding API limitation.
- If you add this mod to existing game where you set Maintenance Cost to something other than 100% and built a bunch of infrastructure, the calculations will be slightly off (in higher or lower direction) because of how the mod works.
