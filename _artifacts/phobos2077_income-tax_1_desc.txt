Adds tax on your Operating Profit (Tickets minus Maintenance) with dynamic Tax Rate that changes in a non-linear fashion, approximating real-life progressive tax systems. Tax is deducted at the beginning of every finance period (year) and uses your total Operating Profits over the last period (year) as a tax base. Tax is displayed as "Other" in the finances window.

This allows you to set up a money sink, that will slow down money generation in late game, without making your early game start harder.

You can configure tax parameters as you like. For example, setting Minimum Tax Rate to 0% and increasing Minimum Taxable Profit Factor ensures there is no tax whatsoever in early game until you reach a certain level of sustainable profits.

See preview image for an example of Tax Rate and Net Profits (Profit minus Tax) to Gross Profit. You can see how money generation slows down smoothly as your company grows, but still doesn't completely stop. Red circle shows the position of Half Rate Income on the Tax Rate curve.
