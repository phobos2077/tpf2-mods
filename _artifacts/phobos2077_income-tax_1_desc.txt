Adds tax on your Operating Income (income minus investments) with dynamic Tax Rate that changes in a non-linear fashion, approximating real-life progressive tax systems. Tax is deducted at the beginning of every finance period and uses your total income (minus investments) over the last period as a tax base.

This allows you to set up a money sink, that will slow down money generation in late game, without making your early game start harder.

You can configure tax parameters as you like. For example, setting Minimum Tax Rate to 0% and increasing Minimum Taxable Income Factor ensures there is no tax whatsoever in early game until you reach a certain level of income.

See preview image for an example of Tax Rate vs Net Income. Red circle shows the position of Half Rate Income on the Tax Rate curve.
